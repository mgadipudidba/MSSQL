How Clustering Works:

A failover cluster instance (FCI) consists of multiple nodes (physical/virtual servers) connected through shared storage (e.g., SAN).

The SQL Server instance is installed on the cluster, and a virtual network name (VNN) and virtual IP address are configured.

If the active node fails, the cluster moves the SQL Server service to a standby node, ensuring availability.

Requirements for SQL Server Clustering:
Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) must be configured.
Shared storage (e.g., SAN, S2D) accessible to all cluster nodes.

All nodes must run the same version and edition of Windows Server and SQL Server.

Nodes should be in the same Active Directory domain.

Key Concepts in SQL Server Clustering

#FCI Failover Cluster Instance:

A SQL Server instance installed on a Windows failover cluster.
It runs on one node at a time, and in case of failure, it moves to another node (failover).

#Nodes:

Servers (physical or virtual) that participate in the cluster. Each node has access to shared storage.
Cluster Resources:

Components like the SQL Server service, IP addresses, and disk storage, managed by the cluster.

#Quorum:

A mechanism to ensure the cluster continues to function correctly by maintaining consistency between nodes.
Types include Node Majority, File Share Witness, and Cloud Witness.

#Shared_Storage:

A critical component where the database files reside. All nodes must have access to this shared storage.
