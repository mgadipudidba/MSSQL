If your SQL Server application suddenly starts running slow after working fine for a few days, identifying the root cause of the performance issues is essential. There are several approaches you can take to diagnose and resolve the slow performance.

Here’s a guide to help you identify the issue:

To track down slow-running queries in SQL Server, you can use the sys. dm_exec_query_stats view. Two important columns returned by this view are last_elapsed_time and last_worker_time. The last_elapsed_time column shows how long it took to execute the most recent request in microseconds.


1. Check SQL Server's Execution Plan:
SQL Server generates execution plans for queries, which can help in understanding why a query might be slow.

Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to examine the execution plans of slow-running queries.
Run SET STATISTICS IO ON; SET STATISTICS TIME ON; to get detailed output on I/O and time statistics.
Analyze the execution plan for costly operations (e.g., table scans, missing indexes, expensive joins).
Example Query:

SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition;
SET STATISTICS IO OFF;
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;
2. Check Wait Statistics:
SQL Server tracks waits that occur while the system is waiting for resources. By analyzing wait statistics, you can identify bottlenecks.

Run this query to get the top wait types:

SELECT wait_type, wait_time_ms, waiting_tasks_count
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE session_id > 50
ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;
Common wait types:

CXPACKET: Parallelism issues.
PAGEIOLATCH_*: Disk I/O waits.
LCK_M_*: Locking waits.
ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: Network I/O issues.
3. Check Resource Utilization:
CPU Usage: High CPU utilization could indicate queries are consuming too many resources.
Disk I/O: Check if slow disk operations are causing delays. Look for high disk latency.
Memory Usage: Ensure there’s enough memory available. Memory pressure could lead to paging and slow performance.
You can use Performance Monitor (PerfMon) or SQL Server's dynamic views to check for resource bottlenecks:

For CPU usage: sys.dm_exec_requests or sys.dm_exec_query_stats.
For memory: sys.dm_os_memory_clerks.
For I/O: sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats.
4. Look for Blocking Queries:
Blocking occurs when one query holds a lock on resources that other queries need.

To find blocked sessions:

SELECT blocking_session_id, session_id, wait_type, wait_time, wait_resource
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;
You can kill the blocking session if necessary:

KILL [blocking_session_id];
5. Review Query Performance:
Review queries that are running slower than usual. Look for:

Missing indexes.
Expensive operations (e.g., JOIN with large tables, GROUP BY, ORDER BY).
Subqueries or scalar functions that may be causing inefficiencies.
Consider running Query Store to track and analyze query performance over time. Query Store retains historical data on query performance, allowing you to spot regression issues.

6. Check for Index Fragmentation:
Fragmented indexes can lead to slower query performance. You can check index fragmentation using:

SELECT
    object_name(i.object_id) AS table_name,
    i.name AS index_name,
    avg_fragmentation_in_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED') AS s
INNER JOIN sys.indexes AS i
    ON s.object_id = i.object_id
    AND s.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE avg_fragmentation_in_percent > 30;
If fragmentation is high, you can reorganize or rebuild indexes:

ALTER INDEX index_name ON table_name REBUILD;
7. Check for Blocking or Deadlocks:
Deadlocks can slow down or even halt query execution. You can use the following to check for deadlocks:

Use Extended Events to capture deadlocks.
Check the system health session:
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_xe_sessions WHERE name = 'system_health';
8. Check the SQL Server Logs:
Look for any unusual messages, errors, or warnings in the SQL Server error logs. Sometimes, performance issues could be related to misconfigurations, hardware failures, or system issues.

9. Check for Parameter Sniffing:
SQL Server may sometimes create an inefficient execution plan due to parameter sniffing. If a query is performing poorly due to parameter sniffing, try using OPTION (RECOMPILE) or investigate alternative indexing strategies.

10. Check Recent Changes:
Sometimes, slowdowns can be traced back to recent changes in the environment:

New queries or code changes.
Changes to server configurations.
Software or hardware updates.
Tools to Help Diagnose Performance:
SQL Server Profiler: Capture real-time activity for slow queries.
Extended Events: Monitor and log specific events for a more granular analysis.
Dynamic Management Views (DMVs): Provide real-time insights into performance metrics.
