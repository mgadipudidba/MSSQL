The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions, maintaining data integrity and consistency even in the face of system failures, power outages, or other unexpected situations. The ACID properties are essential for database systems, particularly in multi-user and concurrent environments, and are defined as follows:

1. Atomicity
Definition: A transaction is treated as a single "unit" of work. Either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Example: If a bank transfer is being processed (deducting money from one account and adding it to another), both operations must succeed. If one of them fails, the transaction is aborted, and neither account is changed.
2. Consistency
Definition: A transaction must transition the database from one valid state to another valid state. Any transaction must respect the database's integrity constraints, such as foreign keys, checks, and unique constraints.
Example: After a bank transaction is completed, the balance of the two accounts involved must reflect the correct amount (no negative balances if that's not allowed). If the transaction violates any constraints, it will fail.
3. Isolation
Definition: Each transaction must execute independently of others, without interference. Even if multiple transactions are happening simultaneously, each one must be isolated from the others, meaning their intermediate states are invisible to other transactions.
Example: If two customers are withdrawing money from the same account at the same time, each transaction should be isolated. One transaction should not see the changes of the other until both are complete. SQL Server provides various isolation levels to manage how transactions interact.
4. Durability
Definition: Once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made to the database are permanent, even in the event of a system crash or failure. The data must persist and be recoverable.
Example: If a transfer of money is completed, and the transaction is committed, the changes to both accounts' balances will survive even if the system crashes immediately after the commit. The data is durable and will not be lost.
